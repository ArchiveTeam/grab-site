# You generally want this ignore set if you are archiving a tumblr blog,
# because tumblr blogs can have tens of thousands of links to other tumblr
# blogs, and grab-site's default --offsite-links behavior will otherwise grab
# all of their homepages.
#
# This homepage ignore won't apply to any of the start URLs given to grab-site.
